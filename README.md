>
> This was a project for the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program that I took at [udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com/). The project was creating a movie trailer website. Our goal was to write server-side code to store a list of our favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I must give credit to the wonderful folks at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) who have written 90% of this code. I could not have accomplished this without them and I want to thank them for all they do.
>
> #### Installation
>
> If you wish to play with or edit this code, you will need to download and install Python v2 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

> #### About
>
> For this assignment, we had to help solve a fictitious [murder mystery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_mystery_game) that happened at Udacity! A murder mystery is a game typically played at parties wherein one of the partygoers is secretly, and unknowingly, playing a murderer, and the other attendees must determine who among them is the criminal. It's a classic case of [whodunnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whodunit).
>
> Since this might have been our first time playing a murder mystery, Udacity simplified things quite a bit to make it easier. Here's what we knew! In this murder mystery there were:
>
> - four rooms: the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining room,
> - four weapons: poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,
> - and four suspects: Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.
>
> We also knew that each weapon corresponded to a particular room:
>
> - the poison belonged to the ballroom,
> - the trophy belonged to the gallery,
> - the pool stick belonged to the billiards room,
> - and the knife belonged to the dining room.
>
> And we knew that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.
>
> - Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
> - Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
> - Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
> - Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.
>
> In this assignment our instructions were to: help solve this mystery by writing a combination of conditional statements that:
>
> 1. set the value of weapon based on the room and
> 2. set the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspects room.
> 3. print the following to the console if the mystery was solved:
>
> > `__________` did it in the `__________` with the `__________`!

> - prints "not a group" if musicians is less than or equal to 0
> - prints "solo" if musicians is equal to 1
> - prints "duet" if musicians is equal to 2
> - prints "trio" if musicians is equal to 3
